# Yoe Projects

## Idea

The Yoe Distribution makes it easy to switch between projects. Before you had to
switch between local.conf and bblayers.conf a lot. With the introduction of the
conf/projects this got a lot easier. You can switch between a lot of pre made
projects. A project consists of a config.conf and a layers.conf file. The
layers.conf file is the bblayers.conf for that specific project. And the
config.conf is everything you would normally put into your local.conf file. To
choose between a configuration simpy do the following

```bash
. ./envsetup.sh beaglebone
yoe_setup
```

After this point you are able to bitbake e.g. yoe-simple-image for that
project/platform.

## Converting a project

If you used yoe before you might want to convert a project to the new config. In
the simplest case you just need to create a new directory at
conf/project/jour_project_name and copy over your local.conf to config.conf and
bblayers.conf to layers.conf.

## Creating a new project

Choose a project which asembles your needs most from the projects copy it to
conf/project/jour_project_name and change it to your needs.
